# Introduction to HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It is used to structure content on web pages. Every website you see on the internet is built using HTML.

# Basic Structure of HTML
An HTML document starts with <!DOCTYPE html>,
which tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.


# Understanding HTML Tags
HTML uses tags to structure a webpage. Some important tags I have used include :-

- Headings & Paragraphs:
 <h1> to <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs.

- Formatting Tags :-
 <b> for bold, <i> for italic, <u> for underline, <em> for emphasis, and <strong> for important text.

- Lists:-
Ordered lists (<ol>) for numbered items.
Unordered lists (<ul>) for bullet points.


I have covered many important concepts in HTML, including tags, Emmet, entities, buttons, forms, and tables. Practicing these concepts has helped me understand how to structure and design web pages effectively.
